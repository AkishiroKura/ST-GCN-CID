## Dependencies

This project was implemented in MATLAB and PyTorch, relying on the following major toolboxes and packages:

GRETNA Toolbox – for graph-theoretical network analysis and functional connectivity computation

DPABI – for rs-fMRI preprocessing (based on SPM12)

MATLAB Toolboxes: Signal Processing, Statistics, and Machine Learning

### Using the Toolbox

Please refer to the instructions in above toolbox for training, testing, and evaluation of our model.

### Datasets

The rs-fMRI data were collected from Chronic Insomnia Disorder (CID) patients and Healthy Controls (HCs)
at the Department of Neurology, Chengdu Second People’s Hospital, in collaboration with Southwest Petroleum University.

Due to patient privacy protection and ethical considerations, the dataset used in this study is not publicly available.
However, processed data or relevant scripts can be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.
